Final Year Project
Android Application

This project is aimed to create a fish feeder that is able to dispense fish feed at specific periods of time automatically. The system will monitor the remaining fish feed, water level and visual condition of fish enclosure through the various sensors. 

The Android application developed in this project will communicate with a Raspberry Pi 3 which acts as a server and the main computer for the Automated Fish Feeder. Users will be able to set a timer on the Android application that will later trigger the system to dispense fish feed for that given time. 

This system will allow large fish farms to effectively feed their livestock in a more effective way.
